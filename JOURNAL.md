## 10/12/2025 - Designed the Base Frame  

In this session, I designed the base frame for the mill. I'm currently using 4040 extrusions and 10mm thick steel plates. The steel is held together by many, many M5 bolts, which should help the rigidity. I think that this should be rigid enough for my purposes, but I'm not super comfortable with the aluminum extrusion. Ideally, I would be using a steel box section, but this would get expensive very quickly, and it's hard to find small lengths of box section locally. I might end up changing it, but we will see. 

The frame will be holding the Y linear rails (HGR15) and also the NEMA23 for running the Y-axis ballscrew. I want to keep this machine rigid and precise, and having these components, as well as a very sturdy frame, should set me up well. I want to be able to cut aluminum using this mill, and maybe some other more difficult-to-machine metals. So far, I am pretty happy with how it is turning out.
