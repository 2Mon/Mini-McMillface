## 10/12/2025 - Designed the Base Frame  

In this session, I designed the base frame for the mill. I'm currently using 4040 extrusions and 10mm thick steel plates. The steel is held together by many, many M5 bolts, which should help the rigidity. I think that this should be rigid enough for my purposes, but I'm not super comfortable with the aluminum extrusion. Ideally, I would be using a steel box section, but this would get expensive very quickly, and it's hard to find small lengths of box section locally. I might end up changing it, but we will see. 

The frame will be holding the Y linear rails (HGR15) and also the NEMA23 for running the Y-axis ballscrew. I want to keep this machine rigid and precise, and having these components, as well as a very sturdy frame, should set me up well. I want to be able to cut aluminum using this mill, and maybe some other more difficult-to-machine metals. So far, I am pretty happy with how it is turning out.

## 10/13/2025 - Added Verticals  

In this session, I added the verticals and the X rail mounting extrusions. I once again used 10mm steel plate, with two 380mm 4040 extrusions to connect them and mount the rails. They are mounted with a ton of m5 bolts, which I may end up replacing with some hex bolts, which should be easier to torque down with an impact driver. 

I also added the Y-axis rails. They are currently HGR20, but I will probably change it to HGR15 for space and cost reduction. It should be very rigid either way. They will have two carriages each, as well.
